# Overview

Data Library is a data lake application to store data, structured or unstructured for data queries and analysis. Hosted as a cloud application, the data library allows for easy and secure storage of a large amount of data in its natural/raw format, data exploration, and visualization. 

The Data Library is a component of the Data SEAS initiative, which is a Mathematica- wide collaborative program towards digital transformation. Data SEASstands for Data Science, Data Engineering, Data Analytics, and (the intersection of Data and) Social Science.
Using the Data Library data developers, data scientists, researchers, analysts can ingest and process data of any size, catalog the data sets, analyze and report on data to gain insights from the data sets.  


A secure, cost-effective application for data management, the Data Library has the following benefits:

- the flexibility of storing data in its raw format. Data Library does not require a schema or structure for the data stored in the libary. This allows projects to upload data from on-premise location, or from public resources. 
- a central repository for consolidating all the data sets, processing and analysis
- a scalable system that can the provide the storage capacity and processing power as data projects require, making it cost-effective 
- the ability to catalog and tag the datasets in the Data Library for effortless search on the data. 
- the ability to process the dataset using tools such as R, Stata, Python.
