# Roles

Roles determine what functionalities a Data Library user can perform in the library. The roles are modeled based on data management user personas and their goals.  

Here's the list of roles and the responsibilities of users in the Data Library:

#### System Librarian/Administrator

* Create project space & user accounts for access requests by the project leads
* Add users to the Data Library based on request access by the project leads 
* Remove users from the Data Library based on request by the project leads
* Support onboarding, data ingestion activities of a project
* Support and help address any issues project teams encounter with project onboarding, package creation, data ingestion
* Address file replacement requests by project leads. Project users cannot delete a file uploaded via a package. Only administrators can replace quarantined files (files not stored in the project bucket ) or accidental file uploads upon a project lead request.

A System Librarian has access to all functionalities such as project onboard, create/update packages in the Data Library.
