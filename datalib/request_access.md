# Requesting access to Data Library

Data scientists, programmers, and analysts interested in using the Data Library for data management,

1. Talk to your Project Director and Project Lead about using the Data Library for managing your data.
2. Project Lead or Directors provides general information about the project and the data requirements through a [Pre-Flight Checklist form](https://mathematicampr.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DATASEAS/pages/1112507445/Pre-Flight+Checklist). The form captures information to determine the different data, processing and security requirements of projects and continuously improve the Data Library capabilities. 
3. The Data Library product owners, administrators review the information to confirm if the project data management requirements align with the current capabilities of the Data Library. 
4. When the project request is approved, the project Systems Lead sends an email request to DS-LibrarySupport@mathematica-mpr.com requesting Data Library access for a list of project users. The list of project users should include their name, email address and role (System Lead, Developer, Researcher).
5. The Data Library administrator creates user accounts for the project team and adds the project System Lead to the Data Library ingestion notification email list.
6. The project team members (including the System Lead, developers, researchers) receive email invitations with the user name, the temporary password, and the URL to access the Data Library application.
7. The project team members register their account using the URL in the email - enter the email, temporary password and a new user password for the Data Library account. This allows the members to sign in to the Data Library.

Questions:

1. Is Pre-flight checkout form valid? Create a template and send to whom???

2. For MVP it's unlikely to hide tabs based on permissons - do we first create system lead account, have them onboard the project details, and then add the project users?

3. How long does it take to approve the project access request - 

4. Do system lead have EC2 account access to view their S3 project buckets?

5. For MVP, which environment projects use - stg.datalibrary.mathematica.org or datalibrary.mathematica.org.
