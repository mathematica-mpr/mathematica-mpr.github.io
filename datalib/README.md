
Data Library is a data lake application to store data, structured or unstructured for data queries and analysis. Hosted as a cloud application, the data library allows for easy and secure storage of a large amount of data in its natural/raw format, data exploration, and visualization. 

The Data Library is a component of the Data SEAS initiative, which is a Mathematica- wide collaborative program towards digital transformation. Data SEAS stands for Data Science, Data Engineering, Data Analytics, and (the intersection of Data and) Social Science.

Using the Data Library data developers, data scientists, researchers, analysts can ingest and process data of any size, catalog the data sets, analyze and report on data to gain insights from the data sets.  

A secure, cost-effective application for data management, the Data Library has the following benefits:

- the flexibility of storing data in its raw format. Data Library does not require a schema or structure for the data stored in the libary. This allows projects to upload data from on-premise location, or from public resources. 
- a central repository for consolidating all the data sets, processing and analysis
- a scalable system that can the provide the storage capacity and processing power as data projects require, making it cost-effective 
- the ability to catalog and tag the datasets in the Data Library for effortless search on the data. 
- the ability to process the dataset using tools such as R, Stata, Python.

Key Capabilities of Data Library include:

* **Data Transfer** – from a variety of data sources allow files to be transferred to an S3 quarantine bucket
* **Data Catalog** – process and tools that automate the describing of data so it can be easily searched and found, accessed, and administered (e.g., version control)
* **Data Ingestion** – perform standard and project-specific assessments and appropriate tagging, support repetitive data management tasks, and allow search and discovery of datasets
* **Data Storage** – store data appropriately for discoverability, access, reuse, and administration
* **Data Exploration** – initially engage data sets with standardized tools
* **Data Visualization** – visualize data with standardized tools
* **Data Access** – allow appropriate, secured, and consistent data access
