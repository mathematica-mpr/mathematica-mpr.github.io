# Data Library - Managing users

The data librarian has administrator privileges to the Data Library application and can add new users via Administration Settings in the library.

**To add users**

A project access request from a project team lead prompts the Librarian to add users to the application.

* In the Data Library application, under Administration, click **Users**.
* The User Management pages list all the users added to the library.  The Registration Status indicates whether the users have used the project initiation email to set up their passwords and log in to the application.
* Click **Invite User**.
* Enter the name of the user, the email address, select the role of the user, and click **Create Invitation**. This would send an email invitation to the user with the user name, the temporary password, and the URL to access the Data Library application.

**To disable or remove users**

A user removal notification from a project team lead prompts the Librarian to disable a user from accessing the application.

* In the Data Library application, under Administration, click **Users**.
* The User Management pages list all the users added to the library.  
* Click the pencil icon next to a user that is to be removed.
* Depending on the project team lead request, do a Disable/Delete action. Deleting a user removes all information about the user from the application. Disabling a user retains the user information, and you can enable them so the user can again access the application.
* To delete the user - expand the Delete User in the Details page and click **Delete** button. Click **Delete** in the delete user confirmation dialog that appears.
* To disable the user - click **Disable User** button at the top of the page and click **Save**.
