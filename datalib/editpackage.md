# Editing a package

<!--You can edit a package to update the package details, remove the dataset file, or delete the package. -->


Note: You can only edit the packages that you created. Data library administrators can edit all packages in the library. 

We recommend that you edit only the packages you created

### To update the metadata (package details)

* In the Dashboard, use the **Search By** filter to search for your package.
    * Select *Project Number* from the search tags filter dropdown, and then select your project number from the list of projects that populate in the search box dropdown.
* From the search results populated, select the package to edit.
* Click the Edit Package (pencil icon) next to the package name.
* In the package details that you see in the **Overview** tab, edit the intended fields to update the package information. For example, add new data tags to the package.
* Enter a new version comment in the **Data Version Comment** textbox.
* Click **Save** at the top of the page. To discard changes you made to the package, click **Cancel**.

### To view the history of metadata changes

Packages in the Data Library maintain the list of changes to the package metadata. 

* Use the Search filter to search and list your package.
* Click the Edit Package (pencil icon) next to the package name.
* Click the History tab to view a log of activities in the package. The History tab lists the updated metadata fields, their new values, the date and time of the update, and the project user who edited the package.

* If you are replacing an existing dataset, delete the current file and then upload a new file. Use the folder open icon to browse and upload a file.
    * It is recommended that you delete the package if there are no datasets in the package.
* Click the **Overview** tab, enter a new version comment in the **Data Version Comment** textbox.
